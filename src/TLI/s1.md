## Primary Components

### 3 primary categories of components in react router

* routers, like `<BrowerRouter>`and `<HashRouter>`
* route matchers, like`<Route>`and `<Switch>`
* and navigation, like`<Link>, <NavLink>`, and `<Redirect>`

> Point
>> navigation components working like "route changers".
>> all of components must be imported from react-router-dom.

## importants

* At the core of every react Router application shoud be a router components!
* Cause react-router-dom provides `<BrowserRoute>`and `<HashRouter>` routers.

## what's main difference between the`<BrowserRoute>` and `<HashRouter>` ?

* main difference is the way they store the URL and communicate with web server

> `<BrowserRoute>`uses regular URL paths.
>> these are generally the best-looking URLs
>> But!, they are require your server to be configured correctly ! -> 엄격하다!!
>> Specifically, your web server needs to serve the same page at all URLs that are managed client-side by React Router.
>> Create React App supports this out of the box in development, and comes with instrructions on how to configure your production server as well

> `<HashRouter>` stores the current location in the hash portion of the URL, so the URL looks something like `http://exmaple.com/#your/page`.
>> Since the hash is never sent to the server, this means that no server configuration is needed.
>> -> URL에 다 처박아둔뒤, 하나씩 서버에서 뽑아쓴다! -> 때문에, BrowserRotue보다 속도가 느릴것으로 예상된다! 각각  URL이동전환이 많은 앱에서 쓰일 것 같다만..
>> 굳이..? 애초에 리엑트로 앱만들면서 URL로 직접이동하는 방식을 많이 쓰는 앱은 특정상황에서 쓰일 것 같다.

## Tip

* To user a router, just make sure it is rendered at the root of your element hierarchy.
* element hierarchy(계층)을 root에 넣어 랜더링할 때 써라, -> elements 관리할 root 파일 만들어서 한번에 쉽게 관리하셈 ㅇㅇ

* Typically you'll wrap your top-level `<App>` element in a router.

## example

``` javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";

function App() {
  return <h1>Hello React Router</h1>;
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>     // BrowserRotuer에 <App /> component를 넣어줌.
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
Route Matchers
```

## Route Matchers

* There are two route matching components: Switch and Route.
* When a `<Switch>` and Route elements to find one whose `path` matches the current URL.
* when it finds one. it renders that `<Rotues>` with more specific (typically longer) path **before** less-specific ones.

## ***If***

#### no `<Route>` matches, the `<Switch>` renders nothing(null)

---

### example

``` js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import {
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Switch,
  Route
} from "react-router-dom";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Switch>
        {/* If the current URL is /about, this route is rendered
            while the rest are ignored */}
        <Route path="/about">
          <About />
        </Route>

        {/* Note how these two routes are ordered. The more specific
            path="/contact/:id" comes before path="/contact" so that
            route will render when viewing an individual contact */}
        <Route path="/contact/:id">
          <Contact />
        </Route>
        <Route path="/contact">
          <AllContacts />
        </Route>

        {/* If none of the previous routes render anything,
            this route acts as a fallback.

            Important: A route with path="/" will *always* match
            the URL because all URLs begin with a /. So that's
            why we put this one last of all */}
        <Route path="/">
          <Home />
        </Route>
      </Switch>
    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router>
    <App />
  </Router>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

## plus important thing

* `<Route path>` matches the beginning of the URL, not the whole thing.
* So a `<Route path="/">` will always match the URL,
* Because of this, we typically put this `<Route>` last in our `<Switch>`.
* Another possible solution is to use `<Route exact path="/">` which does match the entire URL.

### -> 즉, `<Route path="/">` 요런식으로 라우터 path를 설정해두면, 뒤에붙은 URL의 특정 path값이 맞춰지지 않은이상 `<Route path="/" element="<설정할 엘리먼트 값 />`으로 이동된다

## Note

* Although React Router does support rendering `<Route>` elements outside of a `<Switch>` as of version 5.1
* So -> RECOMMAND Thing is
* Use the `userRtoueMatch hook` instead,
* Additionally, do not recommand ;
* render a `<Route>` without a path and instead suggest you use a hook to get access to whatever variable you need.

# What's different `git fetch` vs `git pull` ?

## `git fetch`

git fetch is the command that tells your local git to retrieve the latest meta-data info from the original (yet doesn’t do any file transferring. It’s more like just checking to see if there are any changes available).

## `git pull`

git pull on the other hand does that AND brings (copy) those changes from the remote repository
---

## Navigation (or Route Changers)

* React Router provide a `<Link>` component to create links in your application. Wherever you render a `<Link>`, an anchor `(<a>)` will be rendered in your HTML document.

### The `<NavLink>`is a special type of `<Link>` that can style itself as "active" when its to prop matches the current location

``` js

<Link to="/">Home</Link>
// <a href="/">Home</>

 // <NavLink> can add motion effect(using acttive) it self
<NavLink to="/react" activeClassName="hurray"> 
React
</NavLink>
// when the URL is /react. this renders:
// <a herf="/react" className="hurray">React</a>

// when it's something else:
// <a href="/react">React</a>

<Redirect to="/login" />
```

* Any time that you want to force navigation, you can render a `<Redirect>`
* when a `<Redirect>`renders, it will navigate useing its to prop.

-----

# Sever Rendering

* Rendering on the server is a bit different since it's all stateless.
* The basic idea is that we wrap the app in stateless `<StaticRotuer>` instead of a `<BrowserRouter>`.
* We pass in the requested url from the server so the routes can match and a context prop we'll discuss next.

### Example

``` javascript
// client
<BrowserRouter>
  <App/>
</BrowserRouter>

// server (not the complete story)
<StaticRouter
  location={req.url}
  context={context}
>
  <App/>
</StaticRouter>
```

* When you render a `<Redirect>` on the client, the browser history changes state and we get the new screen.
* In a static server environment we can't change the app state.
* Instead, we use the context prop to find out what the result of rendering was.
* If we find a context, url, then we know the app redirected.
* This allows us to send a proper redirect from the server.

``` javascript
const context = {};
const markup = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(
  <StaticRouter location={req.url} context={context}>
    <App />
  </StaticRouter>
);

if (context.url) {
  // Somewhere a `<Redirect>` was rendered
  redirect(301, context.url);
} else {
  // we're good, send the response
}
```

## Adding app specific context information

* The router only ever adds `context.url`.
* But you may want some redirects to be 301 and others 302.
* Or maybe you'd like aren't authorized.
* The context prop is yours, So you can mutate it.
  
### Example about a Way to distinguish between 301 and 302 redirects

``` javascript
function RedirectWithStatus({ from, to, status }) {
  return (
    <Route
      render={({ staticContext }) => {
        // there is no `staticContext` on the client, so
        // we need to guard against that here
        if (staticContext) staticContext.status = status;
        return <Redirect from={from} to={to} />;
      }}
    />
  );
}

// somewhere in your app
function App() {
  return (
    <Switch>
      {/* some other routes */}
      <RedirectWithStatus status={301} from="/users" to="/profiles" />
      <RedirectWithStatus
        status={302}
        from="/courses"
        to="/dashboard"
      />
    </Switch>
  );
}

// on the server
const context = {};

const markup = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(
  <StaticRouter context={context}>
    <App />
  </StaticRouter>
);

if (context.url) {
  // can use the `context.status` that
  // we added in RedirectWithStatus
  redirect(context.status, context.url);
}
```

# What is the `render()` in ReactJS

> React.js library has two components:

* Class components
* Functional Components

Class components uses render function. The ReactDOM.render() function takes two arguments, HTML code and an HTML element.

## Purpose of render()

* React renders HTML to the web page by using a function called `render()`.
* The purpose of the function is to display the specified HTML code inside the specified HTML element.
* In the `render()` method, we can read props and state and return our JSX code to the root component of our app.
* In the `render()` method, we cannot change the state, and we cannot cause side effects(such as making an HTTP request to the webserver).

## so point is

* `render()` method는 pages 내 state와 props를 읽어올 수는 있지만, 변경할 수 는 없다!
* 따라서, 'render()'의 역할은 페이지내에 주어진 state와 props값을 읽어와 page에 display될 variable 값을 생성하는데 쓰인다.

### shows example

``` javascript

import React, { Component } from 'react';
export default class App extends Component {
state = {
 PawriDays: [
  { id: '123s', Day: 'Monday' },
  { id: '234r', Day: 'Saturday' },
  { id: '12d5', Day: 'Sunday' }
 ]
}

render() {
 const PartyDays = this.state.PawriDays.length
 const style = {
 'textAlign': 'center',
 'color': 'green'
 }

 // Return JSX code
 return (
 <div style={style}>
  <h1>I am User</h1>
  <p> We party: {PartyDays} days a week </p>
 </div>
 );
}
}

```

# Code Splitting

### One great feature of the web is that we don't have to make our visitors download the entire app they can use it

* That means you can splitting as incrementally downloading the app.
* To accomplish this we’ll use webpack, @babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import, and loadable-components.
* ---

### Webpac has built-in support for dynamic imports
  
* however, if you are using Babel (e.g., to compile JSX to JavaScript) then you will need to use the @babel

* plugin-syntax-dynamic-import plugin.
  
* This is a syntax-only plugin, meaning Babel won’t do any additional transformations.
  
* The plugin simply allows Babel to parse dynamic imports so webpack can bundle them as a code split.

### Example

``` Javascript

import loadable from "@loadable/component";
import Loading from "./Loading.js";

const LoadableComponent = loadable(() => import("./Dashboard.js"), {
  fallback: <Loading />
});

export default class LoadableDashboard extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <LoadableComponent />;
  }
}

```

* Simply use LoadableDashboard (or whatever you named your component) and it will automatically be loaded and rendered when you use it in your application.
  
* The fallback is a placeholder component to show while the real component is loading.

# Scroll Restoration

* In earlier versions of React Router we provided out-of-box support for scroll restoration and people have been asking for it ever since.
* Hopefully this document helps you need out of the scroll bar and routing!

---

* Browsers are starting to handle scroll restoration with history.
* `pushState` on their own in the same manner they handle it with normal browser navigation.

---

* Because browsers are starting to handle the "default case" and apps have varying scrolling needs(like this website!).
* we don't ship with default scroll management.
* This guide should help you implement whatever scrolling needs you have.

---

# Scroll to top

* Most of the time all you need is to "scroll the top" because you have a long content page,
* that when navigated to, stays scrolled down.
* This is straightforward to handle with a `<ScrollToTop>` component that will scroll the window up on every navigation.

``` javascript
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useLocation } from "react-router-dom";

export default function ScrollToTop() {
  const { pathname } = useLocation();

  useEffect(() => {
    window.scrollTo(0, 0);
  }, [pathname]);

  return null;
}
```

> If you aren't running React 16.8 yet, you can do the same thing with a React.
> > [Example]

``` js
import React from "react";
import { withRouter } from "react-router-dom";

class ScrollToTop extends React.Component {
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
    if (
      this.props.location.pathname !== prevProps.location.pathname
    ) {
      window.scrollTo(0, 0);
    }
  }

  render() {
    return null;
  }
}

export default withRouter(ScrollToTop);
```

* Then render it at the top of your app, but below Router.

``` js
function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <ScrollToTop />
      <App />
    </Router>
  );
}
```

* If you have a tab interface connected to the router, then you probably don't want to be scrolling to the top when they switch tabs.
* Instead, how about a `<ScrollToTopMount>` in the specific places you need it?

``` javascript
import { useEffect } from "react";

function ScrollToTopOnMount() {
  useEffect(() => {
    window.scrollTo(0, 0);
  }, []);

  return null;
}

// Render this somewhere using:
// <Route path="..." children={<LongContent />} />
function LongContent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ScrollToTopOnMount />

      <h1>Here is my long content page</h1>
      <p>...</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

* Again, if you aren't running React 16.8 yet, you can do same thing with a React.

***Component subclass***

``` javascript
import React from "react";

class ScrollToTopOnMount extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    window.scrollTo(0, 0);
  }

  render() {
    return null;
  }
}

// Render this somewhere using:
// <Route path="..." children={<LongContent />} />
class LongContent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <ScrollToTopOnMount />

        <h1>Here is my long content page</h1>
        <p>...</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## what's the Hooks?

### Hock
* React Router ships with a few hooks that let you access the state of the router and perform navigation from inside your components.
* note that! -> You need to be using React >= 16.8 in order to use any of these
  * `useHistory`
  * `useLocation`
  * `userParams`
  * `useRouteMatch`

----

## `useHistory`

* The `useHistory` hook give you access to the history instance that you may use to navigate.
  > Exmaple

``` javascript
import { useHistory } from "react-router-dom";

function HomeButton() {
  let history = useHistory();

  function handleClick() {
    history.push("/home");
  }

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={handleClick}>
      Go home
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Point

1. If I use `useHistory` Hook, then I can access the history instance that need to navigate.
2. save the history instance(that made by users) to using `useHistroy` hook.

---

## `useLocation`

* The `useLocation` hook returns the location object that represents the current URL.
* You can think about it like a `useState` that returns a new `location` whenever the URL changes.
  * Tip
* This could be really useful e.g in a situation where you would like to trigger a new "page view" event using your web analytics tool whenever a new page loads,

### Exmaple

``` javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import {
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Switch,
  useLocation
} from "react-router-dom";

function usePageViews() {
  let location = useLocation();
  React.useEffect(() => {
    ga.send(["pageview", location.pathname]);
  }, [location]);
}

function App() {
  usePageViews();
  return <Switch>...</Switch>;
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Router>
    <App />
  </Router>,
  node
);
  ```

### Point

1. URL이 변경될 때마다 새 위치를 반환하는 useState 처럼 쓰인다.
2. `useLocation()`함수를 호출하면, 현재 URL주소값을 반환한다.
3. 주로 page가 mount(처음 생성), unmount(사라질때), update(업데이트 될때), `useEffect()`함수와 같이 사용해, 특정작업을 처리할 때 유용하다. 

> `React.useEffect()`란,
> `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`와 유사하다.
> Example

``` javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `you clicked ${count} times`;
  });

return (
  <div>
    <p>you clicked {count} times</p>
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Click me!
    </button>
  </div>
);
}

```

``` javascript
import React, { useEffect} from 'react';

function User({ user, onRemove, onToggle}) {

  useEffect( function() {
    console.log('컴포넌트가 화면에 나타남.');

    return function() {
      console.log('컴포넌트가 화면에 사라짐.');
    };
  }, []);
  return(
    <div>
    <b style={{
      cursor: 'pointer',
      color: user.active ? 'green' : 'black'
    }}
    <button onClick={() => onRemove(user.id)}>삭제</button>
    </div>
  );
}

function UserList({ users, onRemove, onToggle  }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {Users.map(user => (
        <User
          user={user}
          key={user.id}
          onRemove={onRemove}
          onToggle={onToggle}
        >
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```
